## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of medical images and corresponding measurements of fetal head circumference. The images are loaded using a custom dataset class defined in the project, which processes the data and prepares it for training.

## Model Architecture

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process the medical images and predict the fetal head circumference. The network architecture includes the following components:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features to predict the head circumference.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to calculate the prediction error.
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss function.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd YourRepository
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. (Optional) If using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the appropriate directory and update the dataset path in the script.

2. **Training the Model**: Run the script to train the model on your dataset. The training process includes data loading, model training, and evaluation.
    ```python
    python fetal_cns_final_reg_v8.py
    ```

3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.

4. **Prediction**: After training, you can use the model to predict fetal head circumference on new data.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on several regression metrics. The results are logged and can be visualized using Matplotlib.
